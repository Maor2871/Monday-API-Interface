"""    
    This package is an interface for the monday api.
    It's purpose is to make things easier and more practical about the api usage.
    The main idea behind this approach, is to create a server which receives input from a monday user, and update
    output on the monday workspace - automatically and possibly input related.
    At the end, your server is intended to use this package to interact with monday, and the clients, aka the monday
    users, are intended to interact with your server and receive updates on their monday account (boards, items, etc.).
    
    Note that in a way the interface is pretty basic, it does not include basic operations such as board deletion,
    hopefully in further updates it will improve.
    
    Please, feel free to use the interface for your personal purposes. I highly encourage you expand the features of the
    tool and modify it for your own needs. But please do not copy and publish it without contacting me.
    If you are willing to share your new features, please contact me and I will add them to the tool (and will add 
    credit of course).

# ----- Boards columns groups and items creation -----

# Therefore, do not except to track your workspace if it's empty.
# Moreover, the default workspace is recognized as None. It is recommended to create a new workspace.

# Now you can create boards.

my_board.add_column(Column(board=my_board, title="Attached Files", description="", column_type="file"))

# These columns are saved in my_board.columns. This is a dictionary of the form: {column title: column instance}.

# And you can create groups.
my_board.add_group(Group(board=my_board, title="An amazing group"))
my_board.add_group(Group(board=my_board, title="Another amazing group"))

# These groups are saved in my_board.groups. This is a dictionary of the form: {group title: group instance}.
